/**
 * @file initialState.js
 * @description This file defines the initial state of the application store in a Flux architecture.
 * The initial state is an object that holds the default values for the application's state.
 * It is used by the store to initialize its state and can be referenced throughout the application
 * to reset or compare the current state.
 *
 * The initial state object for the Redux store.
 *
 * This object defines the default state of the application before any actions are dispatched.
 *
 * Usage:
 * - Import this initialState object into your store configuration.
 * - Use it to set up the default state for your reducers.
 *
 * What is a slice:
 * - A slice is a portion of the initial state that is managed by a specific reducer.
 * - Each slice typically corresponds to a specific feature or domain in your application.
 *
 * How to adjust for your needs:
 * - Add properties to this object to define the initial state for different slices of your application.
 * - Ensure that each property corresponds to a slice managed by a reducer.
 *
 * @example:
 * const initialState = {
 *   user: {
 *     isAuthenticated: false,
 *     details: null,
 *   },
 *   posts: {
 *     list: []
 *   },
 * };
